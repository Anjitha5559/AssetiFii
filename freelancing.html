        What is Freelancing & What Does it Mean to Freelance?
    </h5>
    <!-- Paragraph will be the Par class -->
    <p class="par">
        You may be wondering, “so what is freelancing?” Freelancing means to work as an independent company rather than be employed by someone else. Freelancers are self-employed and often referred to as independent contractors. Freelancers are hired by other
        companies on a part time or short-term basis, but they do not receive the same compensation as full-time employees or have the same level of commitment to any particular company

    <h5 class="sechead">How does freelancing work?</h5>
    <p class="par">
        Freelancers accept payment in return for providing some sort of service. That agreement is generally part-time or short term. For example, if I hired a photographer to take new headshots for me, I could pay a freelancer for that session and that would
        be the end of it. Sometimes people pay freelancers to work a set number of hours per week or per month. That arrangement is often referred to as a “retainer.” A retainer refers to when you retain the services or right to someone’s time. A lot
        of legal professional’s work on retainer. Every month, they bill a set amount of time to the client, regardless of whether that full time is used or not. It’s really one of the simplest and most pure forms of entrepreneurship: the freelancer provides
        a specific service or outcome, and the buyer pays them a fee directly

        What role can you do as freelancer
    </h5>
<ul id="pointstyle">
    <li>	Writing and Translating</li>
    <li>	Graphic design</li>
    <li>	Programming and IT</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="sechead">1.Writing and Translating</h5>

<p>You could be asked to write blog posts, whole eBook() (under the condition that someone else's name appears on the front), product descriptions for online stores, or even Facebook post and tweets.</p>
<p>You could even try your hand at freelance journalism, writing pitches to magazines, newspapers and other publications.</p>
<p>Just be aware that some publishers (even big names) will try to take advantage of your student status and expect you to work for free. Ask about their rates before agreeing to write for them.</p>

<h5 class="sechead">2.Graphic design</h5>

<p>Design is a bit more of a challenging sector to join when you're starting out as a freelancer. Not only do you need to own some industry-standard software, but you need top skills and creativity to use it to its full potential and meet the demands of your clients</p>
<p>You could be creating a logo for a new start-up company, animating videos, illustrating snazzy PowerPoint presentations, or even working on adverts that will appear in papers and magazines</p>

<h5 class="sechead">3.Programming and IT</h5>

<p>Typical projects include helping websites with their search engine optimisation (SEO), which involves making them more visible in search engine results. Opportunities for analysing statistics and managing databases are common on freelance sites, too.</p>

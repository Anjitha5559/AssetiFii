    <p class="par">This is the concept behind affiliate marketing.</p>
    <p class="par">
        Affiliate marketing is the process by which an affiliate earns a commission for marketing another person’s or company’s products. The affiliate simply searches for a product they enjoy, then promotes that product and earns a piece of the profit from each
        sale they make. The sales are tracked via affiliate links from one website to another.

    <h3 class="mainhead">How Does Affiliate Marketing Work?</h3>
    <p class="par">
        Because affiliate marketing works by spreading the responsibilities of product marketing and creation across parties, it leverages the abilities of a variety of individuals for a more effective marketing strategy while providing contributors with a share
        of the profit. To make this work, three different parties must be involved:
        <!-- this is an inline link, bibance, grow and all other links should be inside this -->
    </p>
    <ul id="pointstyle">
        <li>1. Seller and product creators.</li>
        <li>2. The affiliate or advertiser.</li>
        <li>3. The consumer</li>
    </ul>

    <img class="centimg" src="res/memeber involved in affiliate marketting.webp" alt=" alternate img" />

    <h5 class="sechead">1. Seller and product creators.</h5>
    <p class="par">
        product creator is typically the creator of the product or services. They offer revenue sharing and commissions to people or other companies (affiliates), which have a significant following on their brand
    </p>

    <p class="par">
        The merchants can be anyone from a solopreneur to a big company, as long as they are willing to pay their affiliates to help them gain a transaction.
    </p>

    <p class="par">
        Sometimes the merchant does not even have to be the product creator, as in the case of the “Amazon Associates Program”.
    </p>

    <h5 class="sechead">2.The affiliate or advertiser.</h5>
    <p class="par">
        An affiliate, also known as a publisher, can be an individual or a company. Typically, these are other bloggers or content creators operating in the industry of the product they are creating.
    </p>
    <p class="par">
        They help promote the product or service by creating content like blog posts, videos, or other media
    </p>
    <p class="par">
        They can also promote their content to get transactions by putting up ads, capturing search traffic from SEO, or building an email list
    </p>

    <h5 class="sechead">3.The consumer</h5>
    <p class="par">
        The consumers or customers are the ones who makes the transaction. They are the ones who purchase the product or submit the lead form in order for the affiliate to gain the commission
    </p>

    <h3 class="mainhead">How Do Affiliate Marketers Get Paid?</h3>

    <p class="par">
        how does an affiliate get paid after linking the seller to the consumer?
    </p>
    <p class="par">
        This seems to be a little bit complicated, as the consumer doesn’t need to buy the product for the affiliate to get a kickback.
    </p>
    <p class="par">
        Depending on the program, the affiliate’s contribution to the seller’s sales will be measured differently.
    </p>
    <ul id="pointstyle">
        <li>1.Pay Per Sale</li>
        <li>2.Pay Per Lead</li>
        <li>3.Pay Per Click</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="sechead">1.Pay Per Sale</h5>
    <p class="par">
        This is the standard affiliate marketing structure. In this program, the merchant pays the affiliate a percentage of the sale price of the product after the consumer purchases the product as a result of affiliate marketing strategies
    </p>

    <img class="centimg" src="res/How-Do-Affiliate-Marketers-Get-Paid-1.webp" alt=" alternate img" />
    <h5 class="sechead">2.Pay Per lead</h5>
    <p class="par">
        Pay-per-lead affiliate programs offer revenue each time you refer a potential customer to a merchant, the affiliate must persuade the consumer to visit the merchant’s website and complete the desired action — whether it’s filling out a contact form, signing
        up for a trial of a product, subscribing to a newsletter or downloading software or files.
    </p>
    <h5 class="sechead">3.Pay Per Click</h5>
    <p class="par">
        This means the affiliate must engage the consumer to the extent that they will move from the affiliate’s site to the merchant’s site. The affiliate is paid based on the increase in web traffic
    </p>
    <p class="par">There are two common concepts in PPC:</p>
    <ul id="pointstyle">
        <li>
            • CPA (cost-per-acquisition): With this model, the affiliate gets paid each time the seller or retailer acquires a lead, which is when an affiliate link takes the customer to the merchant’s online store and they take an action, such as subscribing to
            an email list or filling out a “Contact Us” form.
        </li>
        <li>
            • EPC (earnings-per-click): This is the measure for the average earnings per 100 clicks for all affiliates in a retailer’s affiliate program.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="sechead">3.Pay Per Install</h5>
    <p class="par">
        In this pay-out system, the affiliate gets paid each time they direct a user to the merchant’s website and installs a product, generally a mobile app or software.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mainhead">Common Type of Affiliate Marketing Channels</h3>
    <h5 class="sechead">Bloggers</h5>
    <p class="par">
        Bloggers sample services and products and write reviews that promote the brand in such a way that they drive traffic back to the seller's page. The blogger is given the profit for helping spread the word about the product and helping the seller improve
        and increase sales through affiliate links and product reviews
    </p>
    <h5 class="sechead">Influencers</h5>
    <p class="par">
        An influencer is a person who holds power to impact consumer's purchasing decisions. This individual usually impacts a large population due to a large following. It is easy for them to reach out directly to consumers. The influencers receive a share of
        the profits based on the sales they help create.
    </p>
    <img class="centimg" src="res/types of affiliate marketing.webp" alt=" alternate img" />
    <h5 class="sechead">Paid Searches</h5>
    <p class="par">
        Developing microsites and monetizing them can help you garner a serious amount of sales. These sites can be advertised via a partner site or on the sponsored listing of a search engine. Offering focused and relevant content for the target audience can
        lead to increase lead generation and conversions due to their straightforward and simple call to action.
    </p>
    <h5 class="sechead">Email List</h5>
    <p class="par">
        Email marketing is a viable source of affiliate marketing income. Many affiliates have an email list that can be used to promote the seller's products. Email newsletters can have hyperlinks to products and earn commission after the sale of the product.
    </p>
    <h5 class="sechead">Media Websites</h5>
    <p class="par">
        Media websites are designed to increase traffic at all times. The focus here is on millions. These sites help promote products to their audience through banners and affiliate links. This increased brand Awareness and exposure and improves conversion rates,
        increasing sales and revenue for sellers and affiliates.

        It is a public market where common people can buy and sell shares of public listed 
        companies. Over time the value of your stock may increases or decrease with the
         growth and fall of the company. So, we have to choose the stock to be bought wisely.
          For Example, if you buy a stock of ‘X’ company for 200 rupees, then the company had
           a profit hike which will increase the stock say to 250 rupees. So, your profit till
            date will be 50 rupees. In India there are two Stock market indexes Sensex and 
            Nifty50.

        After you are ready for real investment you can choose the platform for your Stock 
        marketing. You must have heard about stock market brokers, but with the introduction
         of stock trading apps there is no more the need for them. And we can buy and sell 
         and manage your stock even from the safety of your home. Two leading platforms for
          the same are Upstox and Groww. Upstox charges an amount of 249 for starting an
           account while Groww is completely free. Upstox have huge number of users as it
            started way before Groww started but since Groww is completely free we would
             recommend that. <br>   </p>
